                        <p>Took a journey in middle high school as one of the acceleration class student who got to study 2 years for a 3 years study requirement along with 24 other geniuses. Schedule is so uptight here, we barely had any time to spare on workdays/school days since we need to learn and do homeworks and tasks. We also had our own events and hardships, some bitter sweet memories some would say.
